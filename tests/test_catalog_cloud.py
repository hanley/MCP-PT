"""The catalog has to declare the ACTUAL ports of the Cloud-PT. 

Measured against PT 9.0.1 by creating a cloud and reading 'd.getPorts()': 
    nports=8 ports=Serial0,Serial1,Serial2,Serial3,Modem4,Modem5,Ethernet6,Coaxial7 
    
The catalog declared ONE only ('Ethernet6'), so any links to the another seven were 
rejected by 'pt_add_link' and marked invalid by 'validate_plan' before reaching PT 
-- ports that the device does have. 

In addition, 'Ethernet6' was declared with FastEthernet speed and the name forced by 
hand. It worked by chance: the right name came out of the override, not speed.
