# Quick Start

Once your [MCP client is connected](installation.md), just talk to your AI.

## Example prompt

> *"Build a network with 2 routers, 2 switches, 4 PCs, DHCP and static routing."*

The LLM calls `pt_full_build`, which runs the whole pipeline — plan → validate →
generate → explain → estimate — and returns a complete summary:

```text
Devices (8):  R1, R2 (2911), SW1, SW2 (2960-24TT), PC1..PC4 (PC-PT)
Links   (7):  R1<->R2 (cross), R1<->SW1 (straight), R2<->SW2 (straight),
              SW1<->PC1, SW1<->PC2, SW2<->PC3, SW2<->PC4 (straight)

IP Plan:
  LAN 1:  192.168.0.0/24 -- R1 Gig0/1: .1, PC1: .2, PC2: .3
  LAN 2:  192.168.1.0/24 -- R2 Gig0/1: .1, PC3: .2, PC4: .3
  Link:   10.0.0.0/30    -- R1 Gig0/0: .1, R2 Gig0/0: .2

DHCP:   Pools on R1 and R2
Routes: Bidirectional static routes
```

## The recommended flow

For a **new topology**:

```text
pt_list_devices → pt_plan_topology → pt_validate_plan → pt_live_deploy
```

…or the one-shot shortcut:

```text
pt_full_build        # plan + validate + generate + (optional) deploy
```

To **edit a topology already open in PT**:

```text
pt_bridge_status → pt_query_topology → pt_add_device / pt_add_link /
                                        pt_rename_device / pt_move_device /
                                        pt_delete_link / pt_delete_device
```

To **check that it actually works** after deploying:

```text
pt_verify_connectivity(from_device, to_ip)   # real ping, parsed result
pt_health_check                              # down links, duplicate IPs
pt_save_project(filename)                    # persist the running .pkt
```

!!! tip "Always discover before you build"
    The server instructs the LLM to call `pt_list_devices` (and `pt_list_modules`
    for expansion cards) first, so it uses **real** model names, ports and cables
    from the catalog instead of guessing. See the [Tool reference](tools.md).

## Three ways to get a topology into Packet Tracer

1. **Live deploy** (`pt_live_deploy`) — streams commands straight into a running
   PT via the bridge. See [Live Deploy Setup](live-deploy.md). *(Best experience.)*
2. **Clipboard** (`pt_full_build` / `pt_deploy`) — copies a PTBuilder script to your
   clipboard; paste it into PT's Builder Code Editor and click Run.
3. **Export to disk** (`pt_export`) — writes the PTBuilder script, per-device IOS
   configs and the plan JSON to `projects/<name>/` for reuse.
